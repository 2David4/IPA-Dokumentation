## IPA Documentation

This repository serves as a version control system for my IPA documentation, which takes place from February 29th to March 18th.

## Purpose

The IPA documentation (Individuelle Praktische Arbeit - Individual Practical Work) is an essential part of my graduation as an application developer. It is managed in this repository, where changes can be tracked, commented on, and reviewed to ensure a transparent and consistent development of the documentation.

## Automatic Backup System

An automatic backup system has been set up to ensure that no data is lost. Every time changes are pushed to the master branch, a backup of the current version of the documentation is created in my Google Drive folder.

### Note:

The backup system uses a Google service account with appropriate access rights to my Google Drive folder. Access is granted via a private key, which is stored as a GitHub Secret.
